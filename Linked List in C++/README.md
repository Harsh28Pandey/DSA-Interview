# 📚 Linked List in C++

A simple implementation of a **Linked List** in C++, demonstrating basic operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and search.

## 🔗 What is a Linked List?

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains data and a pointer to the next node. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory and allow dynamic memory allocation.

## ⚙️ Key Features

### ✅ Node Structure
Each node stores data and a pointer to the next node.

## ➕ Insertion
- **At Beginning**: Inserts a new node at the start of the list.
- **At End**: Appends a node to the end of the list.
- **At Position**: Inserts a node at a specific index.

## ➖ Deletion
- **From Beginning**: Removes the first node.
- **From End**: Deletes the last node.
- **From Position**: Deletes a node at a given index.

## 🔁 Traversal
Displays all elements in the list by visiting each node in order.

## 🔍 Search
Finds whether a specific value exists in the list.
