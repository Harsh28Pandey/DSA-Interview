# 🌬️ Sliding Window Pattern in C++ DSA

The **Sliding Window Technique** is a powerful optimization strategy for solving problems involving **contiguous subarrays or substrings**.  
It helps reduce time complexity from `O(n²)` → **O(n)** by moving a window over the data instead of using nested loops.

## 🧠 Concept Overview

| Window Type         | Description                                     | Typical Use Case                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Fixed Window**    | Window size remains constant                    | Max sum of size K, average of K elements       |
| **Variable Window** | Window expands and shrinks based on a condition | Longest substring without repeating characters |
| **Dynamic Window**  | Uses maps/sets to maintain state efficiently    | Subarrays with at most K distinct numbers      |

## ⚙️ Core Idea

> Use a moving window (left and right pointers) to represent a range.  
> Expand → to meet the condition,  
> Shrink ← to maintain constraints.
