# ⚔️ Two Pointer Approach in C++ DSA

The **Two Pointer Technique** is a powerful strategy used to solve array and string problems efficiently by maintaining two indices (pointers) that traverse the data structure in a specific pattern.

## 🧠 Concept Overview

| Pointer Type                 | Description                                              | Typical Use Case                                     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Left & Right (Start–End)** | One pointer starts at the beginning, another at the end. | Searching pairs, reversing arrays, palindrome checks |
| **Fast & Slow**              | One moves faster than the other.                         | Detecting cycles, finding middle of linked list      |
| **Sliding Window**           | Both pointers move forward to represent a window.        | Subarray problems, substring problems                |

## ⚙️ Core Idea

> Instead of using nested loops, use **two moving pointers** to reduce time complexity from `O(n²)` → `O(n)`.
