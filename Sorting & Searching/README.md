# 📚 C++ Sorting & Searching Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of classic **searching** and **sorting** algorithms in **C++**. Each algorithm includes:

- 📘 A brief definition
- ⏱️ Time Complexity
- 💾 Space Complexity

---

## 🔍 Searching Algorithms

## 1. 🔎 Linear Search
📘 **Definition**: Traverses the array sequentially to find the target element.  
⏱️ **Time Complexity**: O(n)  
💾 **Space Complexity**: O(1)

---

## 2. 📐 Binary Search
📘 **Definition**: Searches for a target in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.  
⏱️ **Time Complexity**: O(log n)  
💾 **Space Complexity**: O(1) (iterative), O(log n) (recursive)

---

## 🔄 Sorting Algorithms

## 1. 🫧 Bubble Sort
📘 **Definition**: Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  
⏱️ **Time Complexity**: O(n²)  
💾 **Space Complexity**: O(1)

---

## 2. 🪜 Insertion Sort
📘 **Definition**: Builds the final sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.  
⏱️ **Time Complexity**: O(n²)  
💾 **Space Complexity**: O(1)

---

## 3. 🔘 Selection Sort
📘 **Definition**: Divides the array into a sorted and unsorted region, and repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) from the unsorted region.  
⏱️ **Time Complexity**: O(n²)  
💾 **Space Complexity**: O(1)

---

## 4. 🧬 Merge Sort
📘 **Definition**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts them recursively, and merges the sorted halves.  
⏱️ **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)  
💾 **Space Complexity**: O(n)

---

## 5. ⚡ Quick Sort
📘 **Definition**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.  
⏱️ **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst  
💾 **Space Complexity**: O(log n)
