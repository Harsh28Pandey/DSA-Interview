# 💻 LeetCode Problem Solving in C++

This repository is dedicated to solving **LeetCode problems** using **C++**. It provides a structured and scalable approach to solving problems across all three difficulty levels — **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard** — using industry-standard C++ practices.

The focus of this documentation is to explain the methodology, mindset, and best practices behind solving algorithmic problems in C++, rather than listing specific problems.

## 📘 Problem-Solving Approach

Each LeetCode problem is approached methodically using the following steps:

1. **Understand the Problem Statement**:
   - Read the problem description carefully.
   - Clarify constraints and input/output formats.
   - Identify edge cases and expected behavior.

2. **Plan the Solution**:
   - Choose an appropriate data structure or algorithm.
   - Think of the time and space complexity.
   - Break the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

3. **Write the Code**:
   - Use clean, modular, and readable C++ code.
   - Follow naming conventions and comment when necessary.
   - Use STL containers and algorithms when appropriate.

4. **Test Thoroughly**:
   - Test your solution on sample and custom test cases.
   - Consider edge cases and boundary conditions.

5. **Analyze Complexity**:
   - Time Complexity (Big O notation)
   - Space Complexity
   - Trade-offs between brute-force and optimized solutions

6. **Refactor and Submit**:
   - Review the code for clarity and performance.
   - Submit and verify correctness on LeetCode.
